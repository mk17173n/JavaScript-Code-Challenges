//             ARRAY LITERALS

let empty = {}

let primes = [2, 3, 5 ,7 ,11]

let misc = [1.1, true, "a", ]

let a = [1, 2, 3]

// THE SPREAD OPERATOR

let b = [1, 2, 3]

let c = [0, ...a, 4]

//Spread operator is a conventient way to creare a shallow copy of an Array


let original = [1, 2, 3]

let copy = [...original]

copy[0] = 0 //Modifying the copy does not change the original

original[0] // ==> 1

//Spread Operator creates array elements from strings.  Strings are iterable ojects  similar to arrays.

let digits = [..."0123456789ABCDEF"]

console.log(digits)

/* The ARRAY() CONSTRUCTOR.  

The array constructor uses a new keyword and used the class word for array which is Array() */

let array  = new Array() //creates an empty array similar to let array = []

let array1 = new Array(10) //create array with a single numerica argument, which specifies the length.  No elements in array and reading elements using index values doesn't work.

console.log(array1[0])// returned undefined as no elements in array 

let array2 = new Array(5, 4, 3, 2, 1) // Creates an array by using the multiple arguments as elements in the array.

console.log(array2) // all the arguments are elements of the array.
